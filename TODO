		   Things to do for AList
		   ======================


* If an alist  holds an odd number of  elements, the last is
  ignored. The  last element is  reserved to hold  the alist
  "property list". Actually there are no defined properties.

    Ideas: "const",  disallow the modification  of an alist;
  "type" the data type of the alist.
