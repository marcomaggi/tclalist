1. Overview
-----------

This package  implements a  set of experimental  commands to
access  a list  of  elements as  key/value  pairs.  All  the
commands are created in the "alist" namespace.

  The purpose of this  library is to provide an experimental
package  to do  some  tests, particularly  on the  packaging
infrastructure (TEA).

  The   concept   of   this   library   is   to   test   the
feasibility/utility  of treating  a  list as  a sequence  of
key/value pairs.   That is: access a list  as an associative
array. This is obviously slow for big lists, but can be used
to store little data structures with a fixed set of keys.

  This addresses  two "problems":  arrays consumes a  lot of
memory, it's boring to configure  an array to raise an error
if we try to set an invalid key.

B. Bugs
