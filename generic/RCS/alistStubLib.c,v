/* Alist_InitStubs --

	Checks that the  correct version of ALIST is  loaded and that it
	supports stubs; then it initialises the stub table pointer.

   Arguments:

	interp -	the interpreter
	version -	pointer to a string representing the requested
			version
	exact -		a flag indicating if the version number should
			match exactly the one of the extension

   Results:

        Returns  a  string  representing   the  actual  version  of  the
        extension  that satisfies  the request,  or NULL  to  indicat an
        error.

   Side effects:

        Initialises the stubs table pointer.
