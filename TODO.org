* Properties

  If an alist  holds an odd number of  elements, the last is
  ignored.  The  last element is reserved to  hold the alist
  "property   list".    Actually   there  are   no   defined
  properties.

  Ideas:  "const", disallow  the modification  of  an alist;
  "type" the data type of the alist.
